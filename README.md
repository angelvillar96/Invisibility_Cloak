> As shown in the following GIF, the performance still has some flaws
> On the one hand, the performance still has some flaws:
> - The "Invisible Area" looks brighter than the background
> - As the blanket used for the cloak is not homogeneous, some areas and edges are not smoothly detected

> On the other hand: 
> - Complex backgrounds do not significantly make the performance worse
> - The results obtained are still meaningful and satisfactory
